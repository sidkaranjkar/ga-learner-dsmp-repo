### Project Overview

 This project helps to understand the basic array functions like slicing, filtering, appending, etc. In this project one needs to make sense of the census data given by finding out the max of the age columns also the standard deviation of the various columns and perform various operation on them using the inbuilt python functions.


### Learnings from the project

 This project enables you to understand the following operations on arrays :

- Array Appending

- Array Slicing

- Array Filtering

- Array Aggregation
### Libraries Used

- Pandas 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The data is given in csv format so pandas is used to read the files in python. Then various basic operation are performed on the columns of the dataset such as finding out the max, the min and the standard deviation of the coulmn.
