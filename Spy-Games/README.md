### Project Overview

 This project in a fun way tries to brush up your python skills by giving you a task of saving humanity by deciphering a message that was received from the intel. We have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message.


### Learnings from the project

 This project helps to undestand the uses of the following :

-  String operations

- Condtional statemants and loops 

- Functions

- File I/O
### Libraries used:

### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - The data that is present to solve this project is given in a lot of files so the data was read one by one from the files and multiple string operation were perfoemed to get the final message.
